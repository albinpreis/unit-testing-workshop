# TDD Shopping Cart Workshop

## Objective
Build a shopping cart system using Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Rules
1. **RED**: Write a failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make it pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **REPEAT**: Move to next test

## Process
1. Start with `ShoppingCartTDDTest.java`
2. Run the first test - it will fail because `ShoppingCart` class doesn't exist
3. Create the minimal `ShoppingCart` class to make the test pass
4. Move to the next test and repeat

## Classes to Implement
- `ShoppingCart` - main cart functionality
- `CartItem` - represents an item in the cart with product and quantity
